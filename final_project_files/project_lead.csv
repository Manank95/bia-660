The Albridge Wealth Reporting (AWR) system is a web based application that allows users to view, maintain and report on clients' investment accounts that have been consolidated from among a number of different sources such as brokerage accounts, mutual fund accounts, and life insurance and annuity product companies. Albridge is a portfolio accounting system (PAS).Programs with accounts set up and maintained on ADVISORport, but are not traded at ADVISORport are candidates to use Albridge as the PAS of record. The Albridge system receives a direct raw data feed from the custodian.  All raw data feeds are then archived by Albridge. Albridge has a server called the Financial Data Network (FDN), which transforms the data from the source into a universal standard format. A custom developed program is employed for data processing, inferring new knowledge and providing a second filter for data integrity. The processed files are loaded into the Oracle data warehouse, a relational database designed for maximum performance, up-time and scalability. This is the third filter for ensuring data integrity. CheckFree APL feeds the ADVISORport data hub with information such as transactions, positions, performance, security master data, gains/losses, and tax lots.  The data hub feeds CheckFree APL with information such as price adjustments and account set-up data. APL also feeds the Recon Tool with reconciliation data.

Analyzed and developed experiment datasets, collaborated with Microsoft Research data scientist partners in evaluating and defining machine learning projects for achieving key data driven business goals and metrics.      Coordinated with the Microsoft Research team to provide statistical models evaluating various machine learned experiments against held off historical data in order to provide the Allrecipes.com and Meredith management with data derived metrics for evaluating machine learning projects.  Including: Recipe recommender, predicting similar recipes to the currently viewed recipe and driven by a machine learned (boosted random forest) categorizer trained on allrecipes.com historical usage dataset; RFM (recency, frequency, monetization model) _ for a new member inducement recommender.    Architected and built a RESTful, Azure, cloud-based, high-volume, telemetry ingestion service, that enables the near real time delivery of messaging required by decision support services. Built and designed the service to be easily extensible by using a repository of registered handlers to support each new message type to ingest different message types, requiring their own custom handling.    Designed and developed an attribute driven routing feature that enables configurable rule-based routing of reports. Used for locale-based report routing, I designed the system to be easily extensible by registering additional routing rules to existing or new routing decision trees, allowing the system to be rapidly extended or modified to support new and changing business needs, through out of band configuration without needing to touch the underlying implementing software.    Partnering with business intelligence, architected and built a V1 usage profile repository that enumerated and collated usersê historical usage into categorized profile system to support personalization and recommendation.    Collaborated on initial design of a Cassandra NOSQL repository for JSON user preference data.       Engineered a weighted randomization algorithm for weighted randomization of the display ranking of scored list of recommended cooks (or other ranked items).    Architected a recipe usage profile topic map of search terms to associated recipes in order to provide a probability baseline to stack rank search terms for any given recipe.    Developed Cassandra data pipeline written in CQL/ Python that exports to Snowflake through AWS S3.    Created ComScore import request handler merging new data into historical baseline in a Snowflake repository.', 'Designed and built a long running user scoring cloud-based service that implements a decision based scoring algorithm for both risk and for accuracy (of complaining users) and dynamically decays existing scores as they grow stale as well as uses score sequence data to adjust the computed final score value by some multiplier that is determined by examining score sequences, also pushing any scores that have changed, either as a result of the decay process or as a result of new decisions affecting scores out to subscribing services. Architected a declarative event based instrumentation abstraction layer to enable developers to declare instrumentation intent by employing a combination of factory methods that return interfaces defining the available instrumentation actions.  The concrete implementations of these returned interfaces can be implemented, in a separate development step, at a later time. Designed and developed an attribute based routing feature that enables out of band configurable routing of reports based on sets of configurable attribute routing rules. This feature has enabled locale based routing of current assets, and did so in a manner that enables future routing rules to be added to fill other business report routing requirements. Extended attribute based routing to decorate content under review with the associated routing queue, in order to help enforcement agents to quickly locate items of particular interest. Mentored junior programmers and reviewed code. Lead remote off-shore team, focusing on tasks at hand, requirements, communicating team status, tasks accomplished, and other deliverables.', 'Developed backend tools for online production and catalog management teams. Created tools designed to automate third-party administrative partner web site workflows using existing and custom developed restful services JSON to encode the data over HTTP.

Developed and coded messaging protocol that dispatches messages to a test execution handler that in turn queues and executes the jobs it receives as testing resources become available. Once a job has completed the results of that job are reported back to original requester via email. The system is loosely coupled together by the publish/subscribe messaging component, allowing the various components in it to be developed, scale, and to be re-factored independently of each other. Architected a messaging system that spans across multiple physical machines, with each participating component in the system publishing workflow status messages that controls how a given job moves through the sequence of operations comprising a complete test run, up to the final step of results reporting.', 'Developed specific test steps for providing test coverage of various UI scenarios that were consumed by the test level code, as well as various utility classes that are more generically used by multiple test steps. Automation test code was developed in parallel with the Carbon Framework itself, and later debugged, once the Carbon Framework became stable.', ' Redesigned the Motegi photo importation component to use a custom hybrid buffered file based stream instead of an in memory buffer as was being done. This enabled the system to handle much larger photos that it had previously been able to handle and also significantly improved the performance especially for larger photos. Extended the VCard import module, using a sophisticated state machine so that it could detect non-standard encodings and successfully import these VCards instead of failing.', 'Added support for missing VBA functionality to the Mac version of Microsoft Office.', '    Using C/C++ and developing in the Windows Mobile environment, fixed numerous code defects in the Time Management Software for the Smart Phone that helped the team to ship the product on time.    Identified and closed potential buffer overrun and other attach surfaces throughout the Outlook Mobile code base, which required considerable code re-factoring and de-coupling, as part of the drive to harden the source code and make it more difficult for hackers to compromise.    Designed and developed the SQM multi-store feature for the Smart Phone product to help the product team gather actual real world usage datapoints and upload them to the SQM data store.', ' Using C++/STL and Boost libraries collaborated to redesign and build a major new release of Real Networks Rhapsody client product with new features and support for Unicode in a major overhaul of the local file import sub-systems.

The NPG product had a number of modules both standalone and J2EE based which were interacting with multiple external interfaces. Integration testing of these modules was problematic especially the non sunny day scenarios.Responsibilities Design the suite such that it could act as multiple interfaces and end points using differing transports like web services, JMS, CORBA etc. Design suite to run on single VM (both client and server side) and without any external database dependency. Identify open source frameworks and tools that could be used so that a proprietary framework need not be created. Design for developer ease of use, such that they only need to focus on writing test cases rather than understanding underlying tools. Solve design challenge of testing whole transactions which are individual asynchronous request response messages. Test cases needed to have a simple way of ""remembering"" their transaction and the next message to send/expect.Achievements Identified TestNG, Spring WS and Jetlang as frameworks on which this test suite could be built. Groovy was identified as the language for test cases since it is extremely easy to generate and parse XML messages in this language and it offered high interoperability with java. Used STS which is a spring flavored version of eclipse which would be most familiar IDE for developers. It had added benefit of having inbuilt support for Maven and Groovy. I created an abstraction on top of jetlang and spring ws whereby async request responses of a single transaction could be co-related and routed to a particular test case. This design considerably eased flow testing for developers. I created a DB module for this suite which could be used for assertions and in certain cases to kick of transactions in place of non-existent or incomplete application modules. Maven was used for dependency management so that individual developers could easily install the tool with minimum java class/jar related issues.Technology and Tools Eclipse STS, TestNG, Jetlang, Spring, Spring ws, Groovy, SQL.', ""Team Size - 1Project DescriptionThe project aims to provide in depth analysis of power usage of huge buildings.

As such, performance capabilities and sensitive data contents may befully protected from disclosure to unapproved participants in a military combat simulation, without significantlyhindering the ability to inter-operate with other simulators. Packets are also rewritten such that all packets willappear as if originated on each native network (Port/Network Address Translation).', ""- Vienna, VA                                               1999 to 2000Senior Software Engineer, Interface Designer, Team Leader - Developed a modular Command Line Interface(CLI) and embedded web server-based interface for ASC's line of broadband switches.

This tool was coded in MaxScript. nGin Toolbar: Floating window that would start when the artist booted up 3DS Max with a compilation of all the tools that other people would make. Coded in Maxscript. AutoCopy: Plugin developed using the Max SDK to update the software to the most up-to-date scripts in the server. This tool would activate each time an artist would restart 3DS Max. This plugin was coded inC++.   BuildLP: Tool that would read from the database and compile all the objects into the binary read by the game engine. This tool was coded in C++.   Visual Script: Tool that integrated into the Launchpoint tool and queried the scripts being used for the selected object. This tool would make sure that the same information specified in the script, would show up correctly in 3DS Max. This tool also enabled the game designers to assign custom scripts to the objects. This tool was coded in MaxScript.   Document Builder: Tool that created a help file with all the events and properties used in the game based on user input. This tool would read from a custom script file and it would then output the help document.This was done with a combination of C# for the main Win Form, Lex and Yacc for the parsing of the custom script, and HTML, JavaScript and CSS for when the user wanted the document in a web-basedformat.

This was actually an extremely difficult task, as the chips did not have manufacturer's ID strings. It had to be done by peeking and poking various registers and then seeing what happened with the chip. Each new chip required a detailed study to ensure agraceful incorporation into the detection scheme. Even the wrongordering of the detection of the chips could cause severe problems. Thesoftware had to be thoroughly debugged before it was released to the public, as a mistake on chip detection would probably cause systemlockup.Windows NT Parallel Port Class Device DriverC and 80386 Assembly - Wrote a parallel port class driver to ensurethat print jobs in the parallel port SCSI bus did not interfere with eachother."", 'NA']","['USC', 'Rancho Santiago College']","['BS', 'Computer Science']"

The core of the software is FORTRAN code developed by the aerospace engineer.Translated/adapted the FORTRAN code into Java and integrated it with an input/output framework.Input is flight data files, one file per flight, in either CSV or HDF5 format. HDF5 input requireddevelopment of a Java/Python interface, based on open-source libraries. Portions of the output werewritten to the HDF5 input file. Flights were analyzed in batches, most numbering in the 10's of thousands of flights. Output is a CSV file containing data characterizing suspected wake turbulenceencounters. Implemented a data masking capability to track the effects of possibly compromised inputdata through the calculation chain and show the effect on the output.TAPS Report-Ingest Subsystem DevelopmentThis subsystem takes raw Turbulence Auto PIREP System (TAPS) reports as input and determines the airline and aircraft type originating the report. The report is then parsed according to its specified format,validated, and post-processed. It is then output in a format suitable for input to the WSI system. Rawreports are separated by airline for storage.FAA Tech Center workThe FAA project tested a pilot's reaction to visual weather information. The platform was a physicalcockpit control console driven by Microsoft Flight Simulator (FSX). In support of the work, developed a track-up map display with in-cockpit display concept in mind. The map displays the flight plan,airports, navaids, and other airspace information. Also displayed is local precipitation data in imageform. Selectable map backgrounds are terrain, IFR chart, and VFR chart. The situational data displayedinclude aircraft weather products (METAR, AIRMET/SIGMET, PIREP, and terminal area forecastsD.

The AeroTech display is driven by a datainterface to FSX.Airside SoftwareThe goal of this project is to spatially correlate flight data and lidar data, calculate F-factor from both datasets independently, and output the results to file. Two cases exist, arrival and departure. Issuesaddressed in development were the reverse of the order of flight data records for the departure case.Also, the time step for flight and lidar data covered different linear distances along the runway, so apolynomial spline function was needed to align the lidar data to the flight data.Turbulence Cockpit Display DevelopmentDesigned and developed software for simulated aircraft displays in support of turbulence avoidance for commercial airliners. The displays are plan-position indicator (PPI) and vertical profile. The PPI displayshows the flight plan, airports, navaids, and other airspace features. Enhanced Weather Radar datasimulated is precipitation and turbulence. TAPS reports from other aircraft are display, as well.In support of deploying the display in a pilot-in-the-loop scenario, developed interface software between a commercial airliner training simulator and the display simulation. Aircraft state information wasreceived from the training simulator. The interface also supported sending to the simulator verticalmotion data simulating turbulence encounters.Imagery from NEXRAD DataDeveloped a methodology and software that uses NEXRAD reflectivity and spectrum width data to create weather images at a range of altitudes. The spectrum width data is used to generate imagessimulating the return from an airliner's onboard weather radar. These images are correlated in time and overlaid with images from ground-based NEXRAD precipitation data to present a convincing display of the weather situation from the aircraft's point of view.Aircraft Situational Display MapDeveloped a map display based on OpenMap, an open-source Java mapping package. An active mapis displayed showing airspace features (navaids, waypoints, jetways, etc.), moving aircraft symbols,TAPS reports and weather imagery. Aircraft motion is controlled by stored data or an interface to aflight simulator (FAA Level D or desktop). Multiple aircraft can be shown, driven by stored AircraftSituation Display to Industry (ASDI) data.NASA SBIR Integration of PBO into ATM SimulationsThe goal of this project was to develop technology to guide an aircraft along the lowest-total-cost route to its destination in the presence of convective activity (turbulence), and other aircraft. Developedsoftware based on an A* algorithm governed by cost rules to calculate the optimal route in an iterativemanner as the subject aircraft was propagated along the path. Monte Carlo simulation techniques wereemployed in developing the results.Quantitative Condition Alerting and Analysis Support (QCASS)The goal of this project was to identify aircraft load exceedances based on real-time data received from the aircraft in flight.

Verified that all MEWT staff members were running Client TortoiseSVN 1.6.16.- Continued to respond to web site vulnerability issues arising from OGP web site scans.- Resolved issues with the Council Content Management System.  Council site content managers update council content eliminating updating of council sites by MEWT.- Analyzed the design of the section508 redesign GUI.- Attended the 2010 Section508 Coordinators Conference.- Attended the 2010 Interagency Disability Educational Awareness Showcase (IDEAS).- Attended GSA knowledge management session.- Attended OGP security training.- Researched various ColdFusion frameworks for the purpose of selecting a framework for future development.  Selected the ModelGlue framework, which is object, oriented.  The purpose for selecting ModelGlue was to increase the team\'s ability to respond swiftly to client requests.   A secondary purpose was to bring the technological basis of the team to current levels.- Proceeded with full-scale introduction of ModelGlue for the team.  Set up Ray Camden\'s ""Your First ModelGlue application"", a training application named PhotoGallery, a photograph management tool.  Pictures can be entered into the app and be assigned access levels.  Login controlled the access to pictures and allowed management such as deletes.- Led each member of the team through the series of lessons to create the PhotoGallelry application using ModelGlue.  The training accomplished the goals of developing some skills with ModelGlue and enthusiasm for developing using ModelGlue as a tool.- Installed and configured developers version of ColdFusion 8 on the virtual servers for section508 and for the CIO.GOV site to temporarily resolve threatened schedule slippage.

Apply section508 standards to all ME websites.- Participated in the design and development of the Council Content Management System (CCMS).  The CCMS provides database support for the three council websites.  The CCMS database is hosted on SQL Server.  The database was designed from scratch and continues to evolve to meet new requirements.  The CCMS manages content for the council\'s members, documents, events, listservs, and the cio_university.  The CCMS allows content owners to update their content directly, whereas previously, the ME web team entered the information into the development CCMS and into a legacy system.  When deployed, the CCMS relieved the web team of many hours of data entry per week.- Applied two updates to the ColdFusion MX 7.0 server in the development and the production environments.  Initiated planning to upgrade the ColdFusion server to version 8.  The upgrade will occur following the virtualization of production websites.- Collaborated with the virtualization team to plan the migration of production websites to virtualized servers.- Improved security for secure documents.  There was insufficient protection for secure documents allowing access entering the direct URL path.  This vulnerability was resolved by moving secure documents outside of webroot.  The documents were then only available after secure login and via the application.- Implemented web page source versioning by deploying Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe.- Implemented the replacement of ColdFusion Application.cfm pages with Application.cfc pages.  The Application.cfc is a component implementation and is a recommended practice.  Propagated web site changes resulting from this implementation.- Designed and developed a common login scheme for the Council web sites.  The common code base reduced the total code to be maintained.  Improved security by using ""state-of-the-art"" login procedures and conforms to best practice.- Devised a technique for mitigating ""Cross site Scripting"" vulnerable URL strings.  URL strings are encrypted before being exposed in a page transition.  The URL string is decrypted at the destination page.  Since the encrypt/decrypt steps occur in the ColdFusion, at risk URL parameters are not exposed for potential CSS attack.  The technique can also be used to safeguard form variables by encrypting before the form is submitted.  The form variables are decrypted by the page receiving the variables.- Lead designer/developer for the website redesign.- Lead analyst and developer in deploying Subversion and TortoiseSVN, an open-source version control application and Client.  Subversion/TortoiseSVN is a replacement for Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, which was inadequate for the demands placed upon it.- Developed an operation user manual for training team members and to serve as a step by step guide.  All and any changes to web page code committed to the Subversion repository are preserved.  The TortoiseSVN client accesses current version or any prior version.  A specific version can be retrieved and the exact code that is different extracted by a built-in differencing engine.  The two versions can be viewed, side-by-side, with page difference highlighted in color.- Developed expertise in the Internet Information System (IIS-6).  IIS-6 limits the size of files uploaded to any web site by design.  Developed skill in manipulating the IIS metabase, a registry like database that stores IIS-6 configuration data.- Developed plan for migrating production websites from IIS 5.0 to IIS 6.0.

It allows shippers and carriers conduct online and real-time transportation bids thus allowing them to meet the shipping requirements. It provides a web-based environment for gathering lane price, capacity information, and executing RFQs (Request for Quotes) with those logistics service providers in the network from which you wish to receive rate and capacity quotes. By automating the procurement process, you save time, begin a very important collaborative relationship with carriers, increase capacity, and reduce your cost exposure.Shippers gain access to real-time pricing and contingency information from selected carriers. Once carriers have completed their bids, the solution will optimize the bids based on the configurable criteria intended to constrain the carrier selection by real business constraints. Contracts are then awarded to carriers that best meet the requirements of the shipper. The solution gathers lane, price and capacity information and then awards bids to the optimal service providers.  Finally, awarded contracts can be automatically converted and integrated into the daily transportation planning process.Responsibilities: Involved in requirements gathering, project architecture, and design and implementing the same. Developed Use cases, Sequence diagrams and Class diagrams using UML. Coordinating with Business Analysis's for resolving issues in requirements.

All these things are controlled using valves. Each of the valves is operated based on setting of the monitor. Monitors are the one, which continuously monitor a particular parameter e.g., pressure and temperature.  Whenever there is some discrepancy in the temperature of pressure the fault monitor is set. There are certain conditions called inhibit conditions. The inhibit condition will avoid the monitor from being set. Some sensors are provided to monitor the ambient temperature and pressure. Depending on ambient temperature the temperature and pressure inside the flight is set. The setting of the temperature and pressure depends whether the aircraft is on land or in air.ResponsibilitiesOnsite - Involved in Requirement analysis, testing the requirements for AMS of ERJ-170/190, designing the functional test outlines and scripting.
